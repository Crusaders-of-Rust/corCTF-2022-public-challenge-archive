Description:

Our SIEM generated an alert about an outgoing TLS-Connection with a suspicious destination port, originating from one of our internal servers. Luckily, one of our analysts was paying attention and logged on to the server right away. She locked the attacker out, but not before generating a core dump of the process that they used for their encrypted communications. We need to figure out which data the attacker might have exfiltrated from our systems. Combined with the full traffic capture of the incident, surely a forensics prodigy like you can get it done.
