Description:

Come play a game of Whack-a-Frog [here](https://whack-a-frog.be.ax/) and let all your anger out on the silly msfrogs.  Due to lawsuits by Murdoch, we were forced to add DRM protection, which has allowed us to detect a player distributing copyrighted media.  Thankfully, we took a pcap:  can you make out what he was sharing?  Make sure that anything you find is all typed in UPPERCASE and is wrapped like corctf{text}.  Best of luck and enjoy whacking some frogs!
