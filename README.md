# corCTF 2022 Archived Challenges

Here is the complete set of challenges used in corCTF 2022. This repo hopes to provide you with the files necessary to try some of these challenges locally on your own (without guarantees on whether they can still run). While not directly linked here, many of the writeups for the challenges can be found on our [ctftime page](https://ctftime.org/event/1656/tasks/).
