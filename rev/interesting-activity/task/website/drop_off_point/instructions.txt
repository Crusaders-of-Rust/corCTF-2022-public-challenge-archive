INSTRUCTIONS
------------

I have provided you with an android application, a file called "note.txt" and another file called "metadata_old".

The android application is to be ran on the Android 11 phone I have given you.
The files "note.txt" and "metadata_old" are to be put in the file path "/data/data/com.example.note_taking/cache/".

These files can be inserted via the following method:
---
1. Connect your android phone to your PC
2. Run the following commands on a windows command prompt (wherever adb.exe is)
	.\adb.exe devices (make sure a device is there)
	.\adb.exe root
	.\adb.exe install .\note_taking.apk
	.\adb.exe push .\note.txt /data/data/com.example.note_taking/cache/note.txt
	.\adb.exe push .\metadata_old /data/data/com.example.note_taking/cache/metadata_old

---

The encrypted message is stored in "/data/data/com.example.note_taking/cache/note.txt". 
The decrypted message will be stored in "/data/data/com.example.note_taking/cache/noteOut.txt".
A script is also sent to you over email, allowing you to actually use the app whilst having root permissions from adb.

> The file "metadata_old" (and "metadata_new" when you've pressed the decrypt button) are there for information purposes and making sure specific files haven't been tampered with - you *need* these files in the directory mentioned above.

Once you've decrypted the message, please encrypt your reply and send the files "note.txt" and "metadata_old" to me, including the password used to encrypt your reply.

Instructions of how to get the required files from your phone:
---
1. Connect your device to your PC
2. Enter the following commands on a windows command prompt (wherever adb.exe is):

    .\adb.exe devices (make sure a device is there)
    .\adb.exe pull /data/data/com.example.note_taking/cache/note.txt 
    .\adb.exe pull /data/data/com.example.note_taking/cache/metadata_old 
---

If your encrypted message contains a 0 (when viewing the hexdump and finding a 00), please change your message - this is a known bug and this will be fixed later.
